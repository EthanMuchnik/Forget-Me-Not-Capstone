# Forget-Me-Not Capstone Repository

This file contains information regarding the Forget-Me-Not capstone project[18-500 F25 Group A7], and each of its subcomponents.


As of right now, this project is in a bit of a rudimentary state, with many of its subdirectories pertaining to different aspects of our final system that we are looking into.


Here is what is currently in each of our subdirectories:

- `Audio/`: TODO ethan fill this in eventually probably
- `CV-Algs/`:  TODO ethan fill this in eventually probably
- `raspi-scripts/`: This directory contains basic scripts pertaining to raspberry-pis. This will likely include scripts that do things like periodically take photos, or record microphone data. The scripts in this directory will likely not be used in our final code. 
- `webserver/`: This directory contains all code pertaining to the webserver that our final application will be running on. Currently, it is in a very rudimentary state, and can only recieve/send files. Much more information is present inside of the directory's readme. NOTE: The wevserver has its own virtual enironment. Be sure to initialize it appropriately before running any code.
- `Yolo-Classification/`:  TODO ethan fill this in eventually probably
- `YoloModels/`: TODO ethan fill this in eventually probably
