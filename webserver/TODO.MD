# Webserver TODO

This hopes to document some of the things we probably eventually have to get sorted out


### Objective: Get a bunch of useful mocks up and running
- mock out YOLO so we know what to send to the database
- Get a dumb website with just a query field and an image response/text field up and running
- Make a mock raspi for local testing purposes [will likely require some additional web dev knowledge]
  - image workflow
  - mic/recieve workflow


### Objective: Get a fully functional system up and running
- Design decisions cleared up
  - database remote/local, sql/nosql, 
- Docker containerize app, we have made modularity a priority
- Database solidified and implemented
- Make a website that looks nice
- Structure our whole website - home page, login, auth, eventually our other webpage


#### Check in with groupmates
- Do we want to go all in on modular, or pick a platform and go with it?
- What database are we actually using?
  - Architecture choices, remote, local, etc...
- some hardware stuff, designing and 3d printing something slightly nicer
