GENERIC PAINS:=====================================================
The newest version of python on this is 3.8



NETWORK PAINS:=====================================================

tryna connect the jetson:

on the laptop:
- network connections-> ethernet->ipv4, set method to "shared to other computers"

on the jetson:
ip a | grep eth0
should output something like:
3: eth0: < BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state up group default qlen 1000 
inet 10.42.0.193/24 brd 10.42.0.255 scope gloal dynamic noprefixroute eth0

ip route
should show something relevnt




Enable IP Forwarding on Linux (Laptop)
Run the following command to enable IP forwarding temporarily:

Check ip forwarding settings on laptop
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

To make this change persistent:
Open /etc/sysctl.conf in a text editor:
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf

Add or uncomment this line:
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

Save and apply the changes:
sudo sysctl -p

2. Set Up NAT (Network Address Translation) on the Laptop
If youâ€™re on Linux, add a rule in iptables to enable NAT between the Wi-Fi and Ethernet interfaces:
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlp0s20f3 -j MASQUERADE


Verify firewall not applicable to me I think



NEED TO PUT THIS IN TERMINAL!!!
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i enp0s31f6 -o wlp0s20f3 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlp0s20f3 -o enp0s31f6 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

on jetson, run ping 8.8.8.8 If it does not work, run 
sudo tcpdump -i wlp0s20f3 icmp
on laptop, it should output stuff 

sudo tcpdump -i enp0s31f6 icmp
This seemed to output stuff if the laptop and jetson were only just connected
