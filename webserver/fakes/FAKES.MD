# FAKES
This file will contain mock components for various parts of our system, to help facilitate testing.

Fakes will be implemented with necessary levels of fidelity when they are needed


### Plans:
- Mock ml model - create outputs for the database to deal with
- Mock website user - send a list of queries to the server and check responses/time
- TODO find what else
