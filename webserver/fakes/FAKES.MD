# FAKES

This folder will contain mock components for various parts of our system, to help facilitate testing.

Fakes will be implemented with necessary levels of fidelity when they are needed


### Plans:
- Mock ml model - create outputs for the database to deal with
- Mock website user - send a list of queries to the server and check responses/time
- mock database?
- mock camera?
- TODO find what else

TODO:\
Additionally, plan on documenting this inside the 'notes' directory
