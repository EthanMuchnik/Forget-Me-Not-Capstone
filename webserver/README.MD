# WEBSERVER README

This readme is the centralized area documenting the work I have done for the webserver. As of right now, everything is a bit disorganized, but I will probably try to organize everything in due time. 

To Organize:
1. File Structure - I want to make sure everything makes sense, and that docker is able to get up and running using this directory with no modifications.
2. Documentation - I would like to organize the documentation a bit more, e.g. add some tables of contents, put stuff in separate files. For example, this file contains install instructions, but they should probably go somewhere else. [done] 


## Useful Instructions:

1. [How to setup/initialize the webserver component {Start here!}](./notes/install_instructions.md)
2. Add additional later for components like fakes, etc
