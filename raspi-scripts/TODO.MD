# rpi-scripts TODO

### What needs to be done for raspberry pi scripts

- Add authentication\
Probably figure out how to do it for the website first, apply the same session stuff to the camera code.\
Alternatively, could we have it where we can type ip address of rpi into login and it sets up the rpi?
- Add perf\
Figure out how to do it first on other server probably
- Add optimizations \
Only send image when sufficiently different from last or smth
